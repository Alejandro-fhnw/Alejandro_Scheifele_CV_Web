    Reflection on my Skills Audit (Careersmart)
</h1>

<p class="t-white poppins">
    The Careersmart skills audit confirmed my core strengths—analytical thinking, problem-solving, and a strong
    willingness to learn. These findings align with my background: from a hands-on apprenticeship as an electrician,
    through advanced training as a systems technician, to my current Data-Science studies&nbsp;…<br><br>

    <strong>1. Presentation and story-telling skills.</strong><br>
    While the audit rates my written communication as solid, my scores for presenting complex content to non-technical
    audiences are noticeably lower. In a Data-Science role at UBS this is not a gap in hard skills, yet it could limit
    the impact of my analyses—data ultimately convince only when stakeholders understand the value they create. I
    therefore intend to focus on packaging technical content more concisely, visually, and audience-appropriately in
    future projects.<br><br>

    <strong>2. Networking and relationship management.</strong><br>
    The audit notes that I sometimes work on solutions alone for too long instead of seeking early cross-functional
    feedback. In interdisciplinary AI teams, however, continuous input is essential to iterate quickly. I view this as
    a growth opportunity: regular pair-programming sessions and informal coffee chats with both technical and business
    colleagues should broaden my perspective and strengthen my professional network.<br><br>

    <strong>Conclusion.</strong><br>
    I agree with the audit’s assessment: these development areas are not fundamental weaknesses but chances to maximise
    my effectiveness in a future AI Solutions Engineer environment. By consciously sharpening my story-telling approach
    and engaging more actively with peers, I can complement my engineering strengths with clearer communication and
    stronger collaboration—capabilities that are decisive for delivering data-driven value at UBS.
