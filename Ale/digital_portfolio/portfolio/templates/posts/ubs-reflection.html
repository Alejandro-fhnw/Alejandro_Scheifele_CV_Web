    Reflection on the AI&nbsp;Solutions Engineer Internship at UBS
</h1>

<p class="t-white poppins">
    The off-cycle internship as an AI&nbsp;Solutions Engineer at UBS stood out to me because it uniquely combines the
    world of finance with cutting-edge artificial-intelligence technologies. Unlike other internships that are either
    overly theoretical or purely technical, this role offers the chance to contribute to AI prototypes within
    cross-functional teams and to apply them in real-world business scenarios. I am particularly attracted by the mix
    of trend analysis, hands-on experimentation in the AI lab, and involvement in a global organisation renowned for
    innovation. Moreover, I have been familiar with investment banking from an early age, as my father works in this
    industry – an exposure that sparked my interest in financial markets long before I chose my current academic path.
    <br><br>

    <strong>1. Technical foundation and experience.</strong><br>
    My career began with an apprenticeship as an electrician, followed by advanced training as a systems engineer with
    a focus on automation. This provided solid experience in planning, implementing and programming control systems,
    especially PLCs and automation logic. Since 2024 I have been studying Data Science at the University of Applied
    Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW), expanding my skills in statistics, Python and data-driven
    problem-solving. This blend of hands-on engineering and analytical training makes me a strong candidate for the
    position.<br><br>

    <strong>2. Motivation and cultural fit.</strong><br>
    I aim to contribute a structured mindset, practical technical know-how and genuine enthusiasm for AI. I approach
    complex challenges with a solution-oriented attitude and enjoy working both independently and collaboratively. My
    values align with UBS’s innovation-driven culture, and I see the internship as a unique opportunity to learn from
    experienced professionals, grow within a dynamic environment and make a meaningful impact on the development of
    intelligent systems.
